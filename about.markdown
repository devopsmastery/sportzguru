My Name is *Neel Gujar* and I reside in **Pune, India**.

I am currently in my teens and am an avid follower of many sports. On this site I will be talking about my three favourite sports - **Cricket, Badminton and Basketball.**

Under the guidance of my father and fabulous coaches, I have excelled in many sports and have won the honor of representing my school across various platforms and competitions.

**My first ever sport was cricket.** I had developed a huge interest in cricket as a child as a result of watching many IPL games and international matches. In India, there is no one who does not know about cricket. Indians follow cricket as a religion and I am no different. I'm proud to say that I am a devotee of *MS Dhoni*, the master finisher in cricket.

I started playing basketball when I was about 10 or 11 years old. I regularly watch NBA matches and **my favorite team is Golden State Warriors and my favorite player is -of course-** *Steph Curry*. Basketball has taught me all about teamwork and I regularly play this sport.

Badminton is also a sport which I have been playing for about 2 years. I regularly go to badminton coaching classes and **love to watch the HSBC Opens**. In fact my dad is an even bigger follower of badminton and also my first badminton coach. My favorite player is *PV Sindhu*.
